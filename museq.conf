## These data parameters are now specified in the command line
## For a more generic config file.
## BS0 and BS1 contain the raw fasta.gz paired read files for unmutated and mutated data respectively
## BS_0_raw_directory="/mnt/wigstore3/main/user/sili/Chr14bisulfite/unmutated_SSC2"
## BS_1_raw_directory="/mnt/wigstore3/main/user/sili/Chr14bisulfite/mutated_SSC2"

## parent data directory stores subdirectory for this museq project
## parent_data_directory="/data/safe/levy/museq_pairlibs"
## the short name gives the subdirectory
## short_name="Chr14_SSC2"

## STEP 1.
## unzipped the raw data, renaming reads with their integer order in the file.
## stored as r1.fastq and r2.fastq in bs_0 and bs_1.

## STEP 2.
## count kmers in bs_0 and bs_1
## output include mer_counts.jf (jellyfish binary output) 
## and kmer_list.txt (human-readable)
## jellyfish is an external program used to count kmers.
## specify the command for calling jellyfish here:
JELLYFISH="jellyfish"
JELLYFISH_MEM="100M"
JELLYFISH_THREADS=10
## K-mer size (for deBruijn graph and mapping)
KMER_SIZE=101
## minimum count for a mer in the read data to register
MIN_MER_COUNT=2

## STEP 3.
## for bs_1 data, assemble kmers into contigs
## builds "contigs.fa" a length ordered list of unambiguous paths.
## minimum coverage to use a kmer in assembly
 ## WAS CALLED MIN_COUNT
MIN_DB_COVER=10

## STEP 4.
## map reads to contigs using maximal unique exact matches (MUM-mapping)
## we need to include a frozen copy of this for protability
MUMDEX_FASTQ="/data/unsafe/paa/mumdex/fastq_mapper"
## the smallest MUM considered by the mapper
MIN_MUM_LENGTH=40

## STEP 5. 
## annotate the mumdex maps
## NO ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS.
## mumdex only reports regions of exact agreement
## annotations check how well the map extends
## and standardize the mapping information.

## STEP 6.
## extend contigs using annotated read mapping information
## step 6A
## Find all reads that are well-mapped to a contig (by ratio match and total length) AND their mates.
## percent bases agreement with contig to count the map
MIN_MAP_RATIO=0.985
## minimum length of overlap with contig to count as well-mapped
MIN_MAP_LENGTH=120
## step 6B
## Use those reads and their (good ratio) maps are used to extend the contig.
## If a read does not map directly to the contig (i.e. it is the mate of well-mapped read), 
## we use the deBruijn graph to extend the map where possible.
## how far to look in the deBruijn graph for additional mappings
EXTENT=500
## step 6C
## Then, we compute the consensus over those alignments.
## We extend the seqeunce as long as the majority base exceeds MIN_RATIO and coverage exceeds MIN_COVER
MIN_COVER=10
MIN_RATIO=0.75
## step 6D
## Determine "containment" relationships between contigs and extended contigs.
## If the extension of contig A includes contig B and extension contig B includes contig A
## we join the A and B extensions into a single contig.
## step 6E
## Remove redudant contigs 
## (anything that is a proper subsequence of another contig)

## STEP 7
## "Unmasking"
## Using the unmutated data, remove C->T conversions wherever possible
## Stores unmasked sequences to match the initial converted strand (C>T converted)
## Uses the BS_0 data to identify kmers that are possible pre-images for the observed assembled data.
## Uses the frequency of those kmers in the data to determine their weight in unmasking.
## This down-weights error kmers and properly weights true heterozygous positions.
##
## smallest kmer count to consider in the unmutated data
MIN_KMER=5
## the lowest acceptable base frequency in the preimage for unmasking a base
MIN_MAX_RATIO = 0.99
## mutation rate in a template must be at least this high to count (to remove unconverted templates).
MUT_RATE_MIN = 0.25

## STEP 8
## align and phase haplotypes
## Uses NW algorithm to align all contigs exceeding MIN_ASSEMBLY_LENGTH bases against the longest contig.
## Alignment is computed both the forward and reverse with the best alignment selected from the pair.
## After alignment, positions that are observed as hets (subject to a BASE_RATIO_CUTOFF)
## and making sure that there aren't too many (MAX_POLY_COUNT) because the algorithms are exhaustive.
## Then based on het positions, find best haplotypes to explain all the sequences.
## Can do this exhaustively for two haplotypes or using SA for more.
## For SA, use USE_SA = 1 and set MAX_SA_POLY_COUNT to restrict number of loci (can handle more than exhaustive)
## That part of the algorithm is sensitive to C->T and G->A conversions.
## Those assignments are written to .fa files that extend the contig_shortname with h1...Hk and unassigned.
## If SAVE_PLOTS, then a series of plots will be generated and saved to plot_directory (which should not be None)
NUMBER_OF_HAPLOTYPES = 2
## we take all corrected sequences longer than some minimum length
MIN_ASSEMBLY_LENGTH = 1500
## removes the first TRIM_ENDS and last TRIM_ENDS bases from each corrected sequence.
## useful if there are off-target priming
## also if there are WOBBLE bases in the primer
TRIM_ENDS = 25
## maximum ratio for considering a possible haplotype polymorphism
BASE_RATIO_CUTOFF = 0.85
## the most polymorphisms we are willing to consider at a time (using exhaustive algorithm)
MAX_POLY_COUNT = 10
## for the haplotype splitting
## error rate
## mutation rate (previously a parameter) now measured from input
ERR_RATE = 0.005 
## Use simulated annealing approach if exceeds exhaustive? 
## If now, will select the MAX_POLY_COUNT to reset BASE_RATIO_CUTOFF and go exhaustive
USE_SA = 1
MAX_SA_POLY_COUNT = 1000
## Simulated annealing parameters:
## how many moves per temperature
MOVES_PER_TEMP = 1000
## maximum number of temperatures to consider
MAX_TEMP_STEPS = 2000
## by how much to decrement the temperature at each step (multiplicative)
ALPHA = 0.99
## maximum number of temperatures to not move before terminating
MAX_STUCK = 100

## to include a contig in a haplotype, 
## maximum value of 1-prob(haplotype | contig) to call a haplotype
MIN_HAPLO_CONFIDENCE = 1e-3
